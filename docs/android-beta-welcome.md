**Subject: Welcome to the CrossPoint Sync Android Beta**

Welcome to the CrossPoint Sync Android beta! Thanks for signing up to help test the app.

CrossPoint Sync is a wireless companion app for the XTEink X4 e-ink reader. It lets you transfer EPUBs, browse and manage files on your device, and clip web articles — all over your local WiFi, no cables needed.

**Getting started:**

1. Join the beta program here: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.crosspointsync.app
2. Once accepted, install CrossPoint Sync from the Google Play Store.
3. Make sure your XTEink X4 is powered on with Transfer mode enabled and connected to the same WiFi network as your phone.
4. Open the app and tap **Connect** → **Scan**. Your device should appear within a few seconds.

**What you can do:**

- Transfer EPUBs to your e-reader over WiFi
- Browse and manage the file system on your device
- Queue multiple uploads with progress tracking
- Share EPUBs from any app (Files, browser, email) directly into the upload queue
- Share URLs from your browser to clip articles as EPUBs for offline reading
- Set a custom sleep screen background image

**What to know about the beta:**

- This is an early build. Expect rough edges.
- If the app can't find your device automatically, use manual IP entry as a fallback (Connect → Manual IP).
- Article clipping from shared URLs uses a fetch-based extractor. Results may vary depending on the site — some pages extract better than others.
- The app requires local network / WiFi access to communicate with your e-reader. Grant the permissions when prompted.

**Reporting issues:**

Your feedback makes the app better. If you run into a bug or something feels off, please report it in the Google Group with:

- What you were doing when the issue occurred
- What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
- Your phone model and Android version
- Screenshots if applicable

**Privacy:**

CrossPoint Sync collects no user data. There are no analytics, no accounts, and no server-side component. All communication stays local between your phone and your e-reader over WiFi.

Thanks for testing. Your feedback is genuinely useful in getting this ready for a wider release.
