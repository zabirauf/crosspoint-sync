## Description

Users don't realize that swiping left on a file row reveals delete and save actions. At least one beta tester assumed file deletion wasn't supported at all. The swipe gesture is a hidden affordance with no visual hint.

### Possible improvements

- Add a subtle swipe hint animation on first use
- Show a long-press context menu as an alternative
- Add an icon or "..." overflow button on each row
- Include a brief onboarding tooltip

Reddit beta feedback from u/Outrageous_Theme_319:
> "Would be nice to also be able to delete files that are not needed."

Author reply confirmed the feature exists but the UX needs improvement:
> "Deleting file is supported, you should be able to swipe left on a row to show save/delete, but its a good feedback to make those actions more obvious."
