## Description

After creating a new folder on Android, the user can no longer browse any folder. The app becomes stuck and requires a full restart to restore folder navigation.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Connect to the device
2. Navigate to a directory in the Library tab
3. Create a new folder (via FAB > New Folder)
4. Try to navigate into any folder

**Expected:** Folder navigation continues to work normally after creating a folder.
**Actual:** Cannot browse into any folder. App requires restart.
